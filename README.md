# Introduction

This is a patch for happybase to support kerberos when connect to hbase thrift server with the following extra features:

1. `KerberosConnectionPool` support multiple specify multiple hosts as destination to connection as a support to high avaliable
2. `KerberosConnectionPool` will auto connect to the next host if current is unavailable even in the outermost with statement
3. Using `pykerberos` instead of `kerberos` which has memory leaking issue

The patch now support `python 2.7`, `python 3.5`, `python 3.6`, `python 3.7`.

The project is base on happybase https://github.com/python-happybase/happybase


# requirements

In order to use kerberos, the following packages is required:

1. python-devel or python3-devel (depend on which you use)
2. krb5-lib5
3. krb-workstation

For example, in redhat install by the follow commands:

```shell
yum install python-devel
yum -y install krb5-libs krb5-workstation
```

For example, in ubuntu install by the follow commands:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-dev
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install libkrb5-dev
```


# Installment

In China for higher installation speed could use "-i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple"

```shell
pip install -U git+https://github.com/normal-cock/happybase-kerberos-patch.git -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
```

# Usage

```python
from happybase_kerberos_patch import KerberosConnection, KerberosConnectionPool
connection = KerberosConnection('HOST_TO_THRIFT_SERVER', protocol='compact', use_kerberos=True)
test_table = connection.table('test')
# insert
test_table.put('row_key_1', {'f1:q1':'v1'})
# get data
print test_table.row('row_key_1')

pool = KerberosConnectionPool(size=3, host='...', protocol='compact', use_kerberos=True)
with pool.connection() as connection:
    test = connection.table('test')
    print test_table.row('row_key_1')

# multiple thrift servers high avaliable
pool = KerberosConnectionPool(size=3, hosts=['thrift1', 'thrift2'], protocol='compact', use_kerberos=True)
with pool.connection() as connection:
    test = connection.table('test')
    print test_table.row('row_key_1')
```

# Important points to remember

* Only support "compact" protocol and "buffered" transport
* Only support happybase>=1.2.0
